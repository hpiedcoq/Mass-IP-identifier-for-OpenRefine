# Mass-IP-identifier-for-OpenRefine

This is a simple recipe for OpenRefine that I use every day to easily retrieve informations on IP adresses (server logs, etc...).
It fetches informations from two webservices : ip-api.com and statdns.com and returns Country, town, provider, latitude and longitude, and lookup.

Simply paste your IP list in OpenRefine, create the project, and copy/paste the recipe in the "Undo/redo" section.
